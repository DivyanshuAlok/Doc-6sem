 \chapter{INTRODUCTION}
 
\section{Motivation}
In this digital era where most of us really busy all the time that parents (or a guardian) somehow loose track of their children , of their whereabouts and what are their interests.monitoring interests is a really important asset for nurturing a child and also making sure that this digital era does not affect them much. To help people with the mentioned problem we came up with a hybrid app (android and ios) and basically shares and battery use information between devices by making use of native modules.

\section{Existing system}
Presently there is no organised system to do so. Only thing guardians used to do and have doing is just checking their phone on random moments or just asking them

\section{Objective of the project}
Objective is to establish a communication like a simple sender/receiver function between two ends namely a parent and a child. The data being communicated is gathered by flaunting the battery use information technically mentioned as intent.ACTION\_POWER\_USAGE\_SUMMARY . Communicating this lead to the parent knowing the amount of time spent on an application as power used by a particular application is roughly proportional to time spent on it.

\section{Tools and technologies used}
Tools needed for the successful execution of application:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Android device running on android 6 (Android Marshmallow) or latest
	\item Working internet connection
\end{itemize}
\vspace{3cm}
Technologies required for the successful build up of the application: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item React-native
	\item Android Studio (AVD)
	\item Sublime text 3 (text editor)
	\item Firebase (database)
\end{itemize}
